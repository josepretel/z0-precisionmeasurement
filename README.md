The goal of this experiment is to carry out precision measurements and tests of the Standard Model using at LEP recorded with the OPAL detector.

# Comments:

1. The notebook `01_grope_screening.ipnb` includes the screening of the manually extracted data from grope. 
2. In `angular.ipnb` we examined the angular distribution of the electronic events to find a good way to selectively handle the s-channel events.
3. The remaining exercises are handled in the file `z0.py`. It can be run in-line or in your IDE of choice. Be aware that it will generate and open figures (but not save them on your disk) if not told otherwise (see first lines of the code).
